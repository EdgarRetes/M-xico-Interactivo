# Mexico-Interactivo

My first programming project using python and Tkinter library for the interface. The project needed to approach education for kids in Mexico so I decided to make an application that teaches about Mexico's geography and other interestings facts. The app was structured in three main sections:

1. Location of states: This section displayed a map of the country where the user needed to select the ubication of the specific state that the program prompted until all the stats were located or the user lost all his lives.
2. States' capitals: Works similar as the states section but the user needs to associate the capital required with the location of the state.
3. General knowledge questions: Displays random questions with multiple choice answers for the user to select the correct one.
